* Configure the scale-to-zero time period.
* Configure the autoscaler.
* Understand types of autoscaling strategies.
* Enable concurrency based autoscaling.
* Configure a minimum number of replicas for a service.

[#scaling-deploy-service]
== Deploy Service

The following snippet shows what a Knative service YAML will look like:

.link:{github-repo}/{basics-repo}/{service-file}[{service-file}]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$basics/{service-file}[]
----

The service can be deployed using the command:

:url: {github-repo}/{basics-repo}/{service-file}
:url-alt-text: {service-file}
include::ROOT:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[]

After the deployment of the service was successful we should see a Kubernetes deployment like `greeter-v1-deployment`.

[#scaling-scale-to-zero]
== Scale to zero 

Assuming that <<scaling-deploy-service, Greeter service>> has been deployed, once no more traffic is seen going into that service, we'd like to scale this service down to zero replicas. That's called **scale-to-zero**.

Scale-to-zero is one of the main properties making Knative a serverless platform. After a defined time of idleness (the so called `stable-window`) a revision is considered **inactive**. Now, all routes pointing to the now inactive revision will be pointed to the so-called **activator**. This reprogramming of the network is asynchronous in nature so the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` should give enough slack for this to happen. Once the `scale-to-zero-grace-period` is over, the revision will finally be scaled to zero replicas.

If another request tries to get to this revision, the activator will get it, instruct the autoscaler to create new pods for the revision as quickly as possible and buffer the request until those new pods are created.

By default the **scale-to-zero-grace-period** is `30s`, and the **stable-window** is `60s`. Firing a request to the greeter service will bring up the pod (if it is already terminated, as described above) to serve the request. Leaving it without any further requests will automatically cause it to scale to zero in approx `60-70 secs`. There are at least 20 seconds after the pod starts to terminate and before it's completely terminated. This gives Istio enough time to leave out the pod from its own networking configuration.

For better clarity and understanding let us <<scaling-cleanup,clean up>> the deployed Knative resources before going to next section, by running:

[#scaling-auto-scaling]
== Auto Scaling

By default Knative Serving allows 100 concurrent requests into a pod. This is defined by the `container-concurrency-target-default` setting in the configmap **config-autoscaler ** in the **knative-serving** namespace.

For this exercise let us make our service handle only **10** concurrent requests. This will cause Knative autoscaler to scale to more pods as soon as we run more than 10 requests in parallel against the revision.

[#scaling-concurrency-10]
=== Service with concurrency of 10 requests
.link:{github-repo}/{scaling-repo}/{service-file}[{service-file}]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]
----
include::ROOT:example$scaling/{service-file}[]
----

The Knative service definition above will allow each service pod to handle max of 10 in-flight requests per pod (configured via `autoscaling.knative.dev/target` annotation) before automatically scaling to new pod(s)

[#scaling-autoscaling-invoke-service]
=== Invoke Service 

We will not invoke the service directly as we need to send the load to see the autoscaling:

Open a new terminal and run the following command:

include::partial$watch-scaling-pods.adoc[]

[#scaling-load-service]
=== Load the service

We will now send some load to the greeter service.  The command below sends 50 concurrent requests (`-c 50`) for the next 10s (`-z 30s`)

After you've successfully run this small load test, you will notice the number of greeter service pods will have scaled to 5 automatically. 

The autoscale pods is computed using the formula:

[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
[.console-output]
----
totalPodsToScale = inflightRequests / concurrencyTarget
----

With this current setting of **concurrencyTarget=10** and **inflightRequests=50** , you will see Knative automatically scales the greeter services to  `**50/10 = 5 pods**`.

For more clarity and understanding let us <<scaling-cleanup,clean up>> existing deployments before proceeding to next section.

[#scaling-min-scale]
== Minimum Scale

In real world scenarios your service might need to handle sudden spikes in requests. Knative starts each service with a default of **1** replica. As described above, this will eventually be scaled to zero as described above. If your app needs to stay particularly responsive under any circumstances and/or has a long startup time, it might be beneficial to always keep a minimum number of pods around. This can be done via an the annotation **autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale**.

The following example shows how to make Knative create services that start with a replica count of **2** and never scale below it.

:service-file: service-min-max-scale.yaml
:greeter-image: quay.io/rhdevelopers/prime-generator:v27-quarkus

[#scaling-deploy-service-minscale]
=== Deploy service 
.link:{github-repo}/{scaling-repo}/{service-file}[{service-file}]
[source,yaml,subs="+macros,attributes+"]

----

- The deployment of this service will always have a minimum of 2 pods.
- Will allow each service pod to handle max of 10 in-flight requests per pod before automatically scaling to new pods.

:url: {github-repo}/{scaling-repo}/{service-file}
:url-alt-text: {service-file}
include::ROOT:partial$deploy-knative-resources.adoc[]

After the deployment was successful we should see a Kubernetes Deployment called `prime-generator-v2-deployment` with **two** pods available.

Open a new terminal and run the following command :

include::partial$watch-scaling-pods.adoc[]

Let us <<scaling-load-service,send some load to the service>> to trigger autoscaling.

When all requests are done and if we are beyond the `scale-to-zero-grace-period`, we will notice that Knative has terminated only 3 out 5 pods. This is because we have configured Knative to always run two pods via the annotation `autoscaling.knative.dev/minScale: "2"`.
